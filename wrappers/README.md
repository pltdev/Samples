Spokes Wrapper
==============

Spokes Wrapper is a source code sample that presents simplified API for
use with Plantronics Spokes Software.

The C# and C++ versions are now pretty much feature complete.
There are Plantronics SDK 3.x and older Spokes SDK 2.8 versions available 
(the interface between both versions is the same)
